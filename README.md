Unofficial documentation and FAQs for Impermax


## What is Impermax?
Impermax is a market for risk. It’s a market where people can trade some of their farming yield for reduced impermanent loss (also known as divergence loss) or reduced exposure to the price of a token. Impermax creates this market by offering leveraged farming and an associated lending market. When someone uses Impermax to leverage, they get to farm with other people’s money but take on additional impermanent loss and pay borrow APRs in return. The lender sacrifices some of their farming APR in return for protection against Impermanent loss and the farmer takes the other side of this trade. A market for risk is born.

## Why is Impermax useful?
Markets allow people to trade to match their preferences. Unleveraged farming only offers a limited set of risk profiles. Some people are willing to take on more risk in their hunt for higher yields, while others are happy with smaller returns if they are protected from risk. Without a market for risk, risk-adverse capital has to sit on the sidelines and risk-hunters must content themselves with low APRs (or be preyed on by ponzi-schemes). A market lets everyone participate in DeFi: whether that is indirectly provide liquidity through lending or leveraging up triple-digit APRs.

We can illustrate increased participation with a simplified example. Imagine there are three types of users:
    • 5% are Riskies, who are willing to take on a great deal of risk in return for sweet sweet yield
    • 20% are Farmies, who have a medium risk tolerance and are just fine with the returns from unleveraged farming
    • 75% of Safies, who would like yield, but cannot tolerate any risk. These are the kind of people who buy US Treasury bonds in TradFi.

Without a market for risk, only Riskies and Farmies can participate, 75% of users must sit on the sidelines. With Impermax, Safies can indirectly supply their capital through Riskies, who get additional farming rewards. Because Impermax enables high leverage, the even a small proportion of Riskies can use the entirety of the capital provided by the Safies. Even the Farmies are better off, because they can use Impermax as a cheap autocompounder for their positions. Increased participation in DeFi is good for protocols offering farming opportunities, because it maximizes how much capital which can engage in farming – improving the efficiency of farming incentives.
